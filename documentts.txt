To set up the project within the 'HW' folder for this local search engine, you'll need several files and directories to organize your code and resources effectively. Here's a basic structure:

Python Files:

app.py (main Flask application file)
file_handler.py (for handling file uploads and conversion)
indexer.py (to handle indexing and database operations)
search_engine.py (to handle search functionalities)
Templates Directory:

Create a directory named templates to store HTML templates for your web pages.
indexing_settings.html (HTML file for the indexing settings page)
search_page.html (HTML file for the search page)
Static Directory:

Create a directory named static to store static files like CSS and possibly JavaScript.
style.css (for styling your web pages, including the Dark Theme)
Database File:

database.db (SQLite database file to store indexed documents and user settings)
Additional Files (Optional):

README.md (for project documentation)
Any additional Python files or resources needed for specific functionalities or configurations.
This structure can help organize your project files and keep different components separate for better readability and maintainability. Each Python file will handle specific functionalities (like file handling, indexing, search operations), while the templates and static directories will store the HTML templates and CSS for your web pages.
